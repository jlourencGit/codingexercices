# Letter Spaghetti

- Create a random string composed of the letters a to z (lowercase). The length of the string should be 100
- Write a program that writes the word spaghetti by taking the letters from the random string created before
- Print the word spaghetti, print the array after the letters have been removed

Example:
let's say the word is exit
and the array is : 'asnkjhrjfiewfiefewfiuuoutizoghnboieofioitoooiixxxnxxttrkjfkj'


1:- I can write the word because e,x,i and t are in the array.
2:- exit
3:-
String before: 'asnkjhrjfiewfiefewfiuuoutizoghnboieofioitoooiixxxnxxttrkjfkj'
String after:  'asnkjhrjfi wf efewfiuuoutizoghnboieofioitoooii xxnxx trkjfkj'
