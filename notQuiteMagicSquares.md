	Magic Squares
	
	For a given width (number)
	And a given  factor (number)
	Create a magic square.
	A magic square for 2 1 would be
	
	| 2 | 2 |
	| 2 | 2 |
	
	A magic square for 2 3 would be
	
	| 2 | 6 |
	| 18| 54|
	
	A magic square for 3 1 would be
	| 3 | 3 | 3 |
	| 3 | 3 | 3 |
	| 3 | 3 | 3 |
	
	
1) Think about the problem in a generic way. How do the values increase
2) Make some examples on paper, what would a 2,6 matrix look like, a 3 4, a 4 5?
3) Write the code that creates the magic square for a given width and a given factor (both smaller than 10) :-> In this first version, I don't care about alignement
4) Improve the solution above to take alignement into account
