# Let's play golf


Your task is to create a display that shows where the ball has fallen.

For that the green is split from left to right in zones
At the center is the dead center zone
When the player hits the ball, the ball will fallow in one of the zones.

For the sake of simplicity, each hit will be simulated with a number from zero to 100

The zones are designed as follows

The goal is to hit the ball dead center. This means, the first zone is 50+-3
The second zone is then left and right of the first zone 5
The third zone is then left and right of the second zone 8
The fourt zone is then left and right of the third zone 13
The fifth zone is then left and right of the fourth zone 21
The rest is the sixth zone


You're application should simulate 10 hits 
and display where each hit landed
and at the end all the zones with the number of hits per zone
